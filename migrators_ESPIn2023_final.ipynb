    "Channel migration is controlled by flow characteristics, sediment transport and <b>bank resistance</b>. Plants significantly and unquestionably affect river shape and migration by stabilizing the river banks and helping to produce cohesive floodplain clays, thereby increasing resistance to erosion.‚Äù [(Zinke, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0016-3). In this JupyterNotebook we will learn how the presence of vegetation can affect channel migration through different vegetation densities and distributions.\n"

    "For this we will be using [meanderpy](https://github.com/zsylvester/meanderpy), a Python module that implements a simple numerical model of river meandering. This model is based on a nonlinear relationship based on field observations that suggested a complex link between curvature and migration rate. For more information, the model is further described in [Howard and Knutson, 1984](https://doi.org/10.1029/WR020i011p01659)"
